Caroline was eating her scrambled
eggs too fast.
“Don't gobble, Caroline,” her mother
said. “You have plenty of time. The
movie doesn't begin until ten o'clock.”
It was Saturday morning, and
Pinocchio was going to be shown at
school.
“But I have to be first in line,” said
Caroline. “If I'm first, maybe I will
get to sit next to Miss Olmstead.”
Miss Olmstead was Caroline's
favorite teacher. She had long brown
hair and she smiled a lot.
Caroline finished her eggs, put on
her coat, and ran to the door.
But her mother called after her,
“Caroline, come back. You forgot to
brush your teeth.”
Caroline ran back, brushed her
teeth, and ran to the door.
But her mother called after her,
“Caroline, you forgot your quarter
for the movie. Come back and I'll
give it to you.”
The principal was going to collect all
the quarters to buy toys for children in
the hospital.
While her mother looked in her
purse for the quarter, Caroline hopped
up and down saying, “Please hurry!”
She did want to be first in line.
Caroline hurried to school as fast as
she could, but she arrived too late.
Nancy was already standing on the top
step of the main entrance. Caroline
took her place behind Nancy. She was
disappointed not to be first, but it
wasn't too bad to be second. After all,
Miss Olmstead had two sides. If Nancy
sat on one side, Caroline could have
the other side.
But now Frances was coming up
to join them. Frances was Nancy's best
friend.
Frances said, “Caroline, could I please
stand in front of you, so I can be right
after Nancy?”
Caroline shook her head. She
couldn't let Frances stand in front of
her. That would make her third, and
Miss Olmstead didn't have three sides.
Frances turned to Nancy. “Nancy,
you'll let me stand in front of you
won't you?”
Nancy said, “All right.” She couldn't
say no to her best friend.
So now Caroline was third in line.
More children kept coming. Frances
let a boy with red hair stand in front
of her, and he let a boy with a
computer game stand in front of him.
Everyone else who came was able to
get into line ahead of a friend.
The line grew longer and longer.
Poor Caroline wasn't third anymore.
Soon she was tenth, then twenty-first.
No matter how many children came,
Caroline was last in line.
By ten o'clock the line stretched all
the way around the school to the side
entrance. Caroline was standing just
in front of the side entrance when
the door suddenly opened.
The principal was there. He was
surprised to see the line of children
facing the wrong way. “Now, why on
earth . . . ,” he wondered aloud. Then
he said, “I guess no one told them to
come in the side entrance.”
The principal cupped his hands
around his mouth and called, “Turn
around, boys and girls, and have your
quarters ready!”
Naturally, Caroline was first in line.
At last! She gave her quarter to the
principal and went into the auditorium.
Miss Olmstead was already sitting
down. Caroline went over and sat
down in the seat next to her.
“Well, Caroline!” Miss Olmstead
said, smiling. “You must have hurried
to be first inside.”
“I did,” said Caroline happily, and
she settled back to wait for the movie
to begin.
